Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am Sayak (à¦¸à¦¾à§Ÿà¦•) Paul. I work on [ðŸ§¨ diffusers](https://hf.co/docs/diffusers) at [Hugging Face](https://hf.co). Know more about me
from [here](https://sayak.dev/about/). I maintain a Google Doc answering some FAQs at length. You can check it out [here](https://bit.ly/sayak-faqs). 

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for
Jupyter Notebooks.

My external articles and other publishing engagements (like books, liveProjects, etc.) are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). Decks
from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops/). Interviews are [here](https://sayak.dev/interviews/).
