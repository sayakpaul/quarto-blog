This post is a reflection of what had to be done to get to that point. First, we’ll discuss the implementation of ConvNeXt in Keras and how the original pre-trained parameters were ported into these models. We’ll then talk about TF-Hub’s ConvNeXt collection and what it offers. \n",

    "# About ConvNeXt\n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNeXt models were proposed by Liu et al. in [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545). ConvNeXt models are composed of standard layers such as depthwise convolutions, layer normalization, etc., and use standard network topologies. They don’t use self-attention or any hybrid approaches, unlike the recent architectures such as [Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), [CoAtNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04803), etc. The authors start with a base architecture and gradually refine it to match some of the design choices of [Swin Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030). In the process, they developed a family of models named ConvNeXt achieving performance on the [ImageNet-1k dataset](https://www.image-net.org/) with efficiency. For details, check out the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545). \n",

    "\n",
    "The ConvNeXt models are fairly easy to implement especially with the [official PyTorch codebase available](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt) for reference. As mentioned before, these models can be implemented using the standard components provided in most of the major deep learning frameworks such as JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. \n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNeXt models use the following block structure with layer scaling as introduced in [Going deeper with image transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239) by Touvron et al.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip connection is controlled with [Stochastic Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382) to induce regularization *during* training. Different ConvNeXt variants correspond to different depths along with different channels used in each of the stages. For example, the \"tiny\" variant uses the following setup: \n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "depths = [3, 3, 9, 3]\n",
    "dims = [96, 192, 384, 768]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan to populate the implemented models with the original parameters then it helps to align the architecture implementation with the official one as much as possible. Since I went with this approach I tried closely following [the official implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt/blob/main/models/convnext.py). My final implementation is available in [this script](https://github.com/sayakpaul/ConvNeXt-TF/blob/main/models/convnext_tf.py). Note that, it does not yet include the [isotropic ConvNeXt models](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt/blob/main/models/convnext_isotropic.py). \n",
    "\n",
    "Coming to the weight porting part, this is usually the most interesting part because there’s no standard recipe that’d work for all the models. You’ll need to think about how to best align the original model parameters with your implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A ConvNeXt model is divided into three main parts: (1) stem which directly operates on the input image, (2) downsample blocks that reduce the resolution of feature maps as the network progresses, and (3) stages that apply the ConvNeXt blocks shown above. This is why I organized my weight porting script such that it has a correspondence between these different parts with the original parameters. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "for layer in stem_block.layers:\n",
    "    if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Conv2D):\n",
    "        layer.kernel.assign(\n",
    "            tf.Variable(param_list[0].numpy().transpose(2, 3, 1, 0))\n",
    "        )\n",
    "        layer.bias.assign(tf.Variable(param_list[1].numpy()))\n",
    "    elif isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization):\n",
    "        layer.gamma.assign(tf.Variable(param_list[2].numpy()))\n",
    "        layer.beta.assign(tf.Variable(param_list[3].numpy()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult bit was figuring out how to properly populate the weights of the convolutional layers in TensorFlow from PyTorch. In an earlier implementation, I was simply using `transpose()`. The resulting models were giving poorer performance than expected. [Vasudev](https://in.linkedin.com/in/vasudevgupta7) helped me figure out the correct transposition of the weight axes and the models were then coming out as expected. More about the evaluation of these models in a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the weights were ported successfully, the next task was to verify if the outputs of the intermediate layers matched with their original counterparts. One minor detail to note here is that the outputs of layers are **not** the same as their parameters. So, even if you check if the parameters of your implemented model and the original model are matching, their outputs could still mismatch. This mainly happens because of mismatches between the layer configurations of your model and the original one.\n",

The script is available [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/ConvNeXt-TF/blob/main/hub_utilities/generate_doc.py).

Additionally, I worked on a [script](https://github.com/sayakpaul/ConvNeXt-TF/blob/main/hub_utilities/export_to_hub.py) that can archive the TensorFlow SavedModels in a way accepted by TF-Hub. \n",
