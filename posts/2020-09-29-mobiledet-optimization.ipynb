    "This year researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Google published their work on [MobileDet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14525). MobileDet presents an architectural philosophy for designing object detectors specifically targeted toward running on mobile accelerators like DSP, EdgeTPU, and so on. MobileDet yields significant improvement over architectures MobileNetV2+SSDLite and MobileNetV3+SSDLite on the [COCO object detection task](https://cocodataset.org/) with the same accelerated inference time. Long story cut short, if you are planning to use object detection models in mobile applications MobileDets may be an extremely good choice. \n",

After all, there are so many great examples and tutorials that show how to use the [<span class=\"underline\">post-training quantization APIs</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization) in TFLite to perform the model conversion.

If you ever wanted to use the latest TFLite converter to do the conversion, that may not be immediately approachable.\n",

The models in `uint8` precision were trained using [<span class=\"underline\">quantization aware training</span>](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/04/quantization-aware-training-with-tensorflow-model-optimization-toolkit.html) (QAT) while the `float32` models were not. During QAT fake quantization nodes get inserted into a model’s computation graph. So, the models trained using QAT usually require some extra care during the TFLite conversion process as we'll see in a moment.\n",

Both of these scripts add optimized postprocessing operations to the model graph. Now, these operations are not yet supported in int8 precision. So, if you ever wanted to convert these pre-trained checkpoints using [<span class=\"underline\">full integer quantization</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization#full_integer_quantization), what would have been your approach?\n",
