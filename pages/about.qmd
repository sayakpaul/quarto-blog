I am generally interested in the area of representation learning. More specifically, I am interested in the following areas: semi-supervision, self-supervision, and model robustness.  I work on diffusion models at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). My day-to-day includes contributing features to [ðŸ§¨ diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), maintaining it, training and babysitting diffusion models, documenting them, and sometimes mudding up the social media with emojis (kidding ðŸ˜‚). For more details on my work experience, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayak-paul/).

I enjoy implementing research ideas, sometimes incorporating them into practical applications, and communicating my implementation details through [articles](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). I advocate for highly readable and self-contained code. I primarily use Python for programming. 

I have a flair for open-source initiatives. In particular, I have contributed to <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commits?author=sayakpaul"><font color="#d00000">Keras</font></a>, [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv/commits?author=sayakpaul), [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commits?author=sayakpaul), <a href="https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=sayakpaul"><font color="#FF6F00">TensorFlow Hub</font></a>, <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/commits?author=sayakpaul"><font color="#d00000">Keras Examples</font></a>, [TensorFlow Addons](https://git.io/JuUOr), and [Neural Structured Learning](https://git.io/JuUOd). Thanks to my job, I get to do open-source full-time now! Off the work, I like writing technical articles, working on applied ML ideas, and giving talks at developer conferences.

For my community contributions and innovative projects, the Intel Software Innovator Program recognized me as one of [their top innovators in 2019](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzsy1q8jgkwj6cj/Intel_Top_Innovator_2019.jpg?dl=0). For my open-source contributions, I received the Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award in [2020](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html), [2021](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/09/announcing-latest-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html), and [2022](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/09/announcing-the-second-group-of-open-source-peer-bonus-winners-in-2022.html), and [TensorFlow Top Contributor Award](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/11/2021-TF-Contributor-Awardees.html?linkId=8010214) in 2021. A detailed account of the awards and recognitions is available [here](https://sayak.dev/xyz/#awards-and-recognition).
